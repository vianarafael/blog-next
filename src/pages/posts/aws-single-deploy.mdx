# Creating the Front-End & Back-End

Create a react application using create-react-app.

On the root folder create a server.js file, and install express,cors and axios.

Create an express server:

server.js

```
const express = require("express");
const cors = require("cors");
const path = require("path");
const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "build")));
app.use(express.static("public"));

app.get("/api", (req, res) => {
 res.send("Hello, world!!!");
});

app.listen(3001);

```

The app is serving the react build files, and sending the data from the /api endpoint.

On the package.json add a proxy to the backend.

package.json

```
...
"proxy": "http://localhost:3001",
...
```

Get the data being served on the front-end:

src/App.js

```
import { useEffect } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

function App() {
 useEffect(() => {
   axios.get("/api").then((res) => console.log(res.data));
 }, []);
...
```

# CodeDeploy prep

Since our application will use the EC2/On-Premises compute platform, we need to create an AppSpec file on the root of our project.

This will determine:

- What will be installed in the instance
- Which lifecycle event hook to run in response to deployment lifecycle events

appspec.yml

```
version: 0.0
os: linux
files:
 - source: /
   destination: /home/ec2-user/fullstack-app
hooks:
 ApplicationStop:
   - location: scripts/application_stop.sh
     timeout: 300
     runas: ec2-user
 BeforeInstall:
   - location: scripts/before_install.sh
     timeout: 300
     runas: ec2-user
 ApplicationStart:
   - location: scripts/application_start.sh
     timeout: 300
     runas: ec2-user

```

Now, letâ€™s create the scripts specified on the lifecycle event hooks:

scripts/application_stop.sh

```
#!/bin/bash
#Stopping existing node servers
echo "Stopping any existing node servers"
pkill node

```

scripts/before_install.sh

```
#!/bin/bash

#download node and npm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install node

#create our working directory if it doesnt exist
DIR="/home/ec2-user/fullstack-app"
if [ -d "$DIR" ]; then
  echo "${DIR} exists"
else
  echo "Creating ${DIR} directory"
  mkdir ${DIR}
fi


```

scripts/application_start.sh

```
#!/bin/bash

#give permission for everything in the express-app directory
sudo chmod -R 777 /home/ec2-user/fullstack-app

#navigate into our working directory where we have all our github files
cd /home/ec2-user/fullstack-app

#add npm and node to path
export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # loads nvm bash_completion (node is in path now)

#install node modules
npm install

#start our node app in the background
node server.js > app.out.log 2> app.err.log < /dev/null &

```

Push the code to a Github repo.

# On your AWS Management Console

### create 2 IAM roles:

- For the EC2 instance (filter the policy AmazonEC2RoleforAWSCodeDeploy)
- For the CodeDeploy

### Create an EC2 instance (using Linux OS)

On Step3: Configure Instance Details, change:
IAM role to the one that you created for the EC2 instance
On the Advanced Details sections add the following script:

```
#!/bin/bash
sudo yum -y update
sudo yum -y install ruby
sudo yum -y install wget
cd /home/ec2-user
wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/latest/install
sudo chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install auto

```

This will install the CodeDeploy Agent on EC2 creation.

On Step5: Tags
Add a tag to identify your instance:
Key: Name Value: WhateverYouLike

On Step6: Configure security group
Add a HTTP type and a Custom TCP Rule to Port 3001 (the port our server is listening to) - this is just for demo purpose - for production you want to set an ALB or API gateway point to it.

Create a CodeDeploy Application.
The compute platform should be EC2 Instance/On-premises
The service role should be the IAM role you created for CodeDeploy

Because there is only one instance uncheck the Load Balancer box

### Create a pipeline

The source provider should be Github v2
Connect to Github and choose your repo and main branch

Wait until deployed. And you can access your app using the Public IPv4 DNS from your EC2 role.
Any changes you push to github will be automatically deployed.
