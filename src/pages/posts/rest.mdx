## There are two different approaches for architectural design:
1. Start with a blank drawing board - and build-up architecture from known components. This emphasizes creativity.
2. Start with the system needs, and start applying constraints to elements that will benefit the system as a whole. This emphasizes restraint and understanding of the system context.

REST is a fruit of the second approach.

REST = Representational State Transfer

## It is based on Resources (resources are just stuff).
Rafael is an example of a user resource.

## Representations is how those resources get manipulated
An example is JSON.
e.g. 
Resource: person Rafael
Service: contact info (GET)
Representation: name. Twitter, github
{ 
“name”: “Rafael Viana”, 
“Twitter”: “@vianarafaelds”,
“Github”: “vianarafael”
}

## Constraints
There are six constraints to a RESTful API:

# 1. Uniform interface
The format of you API, i.e.:
HTTP verbs (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE)
URIs (resource name)
HTTP responses (status, body, head, …)

# 2. Stateless
Servers do not hold client state
Each request have enough context to process the message
Session state is kept on the client

# 3. Client-Server
Separation of concerns
The systems are assumed to be disconnected
Uniform interface is what links the disconnected systems

# 4. Cacheable
Server responses (representations) are cacheable

# 5. Layered Systems
The client doesn't know the inner working of the API - the client only knows the representation that comes back.

# 6. Code on Demand
(That is the only optional constraint).

The server can transfer logic to the client - and the client executes the logic.

That summary was based on [Roy Fielding's Dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)
