# Creating the Front-End & Back-End

Let's start by bootstrapping our application with `create-react-app`

Now let's create a simple server that will send data to our front-end.

We need to install express:

```
yarn add express
```

or

```
npm i express
```

Next step is to create a simple server.
On the root directory, create a server.js file - and in that file let's write our server.

```
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3001;

app.use(express.static(__dirname + '/build'));

app.listen(PORT,
() => console.log(`App listening on ${PORT} ðŸš€`))
```

Currently our package.json looks like this:

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
  },
```

Let's make the start script be what we use to run the server:

```
  "scripts": {
    "serve": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
```

Let's add an endpoint with some data to be served - on your server.js add:

```
app.use('/api', (req, res) => {
    res.send('data from the server');
})
```

if you navigate to localhost:3001/api you will be able to see the data (make sure the server is running)

And finally, let's call our endpoint from the front-end:

You can use fetch, but I prefer axios (install it w/ yarn or npm)

if we were to hardcode our server address it would be:

```
axios.get('localhost:3001/api')
```

The problem is now that only works for development, when we deploy the app to heroku we will have to change the api call to something like:

```
axios.get('whatever-is-the-name-on-heroku/api')
```

A better option is to call it relatively

```
axios.get('/api')
```

That will work for production, but not development.
We nee to let our development know about our server:

# Adding a proxy

we can achieve that by adding a proxy - on our package.json:

```
...
proxy: "http://localhost:3001",
...
```

# Get the server data on the Front-End

We are now ready to call it from the front-end (on the App.js):

```
import axios from 'axios';
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [data, setData] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/api').then((res) => setData(res.data));
  }, []);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <p>{data}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

Cool! We have our data.

Now lets deploy to Heroku (you will need a Heroku account & Heroku CLI)
Create a new app on heroku, and :

# Login

```
heroku login
```

# Clone the repository

```
heroku git:clone -a the-name-of-your-app
cd the-name-of-your-app
```

# Deploy your changes

```
git add -A
git commit -m "deploying to Heroku"
git push heroku main
```

And that is it - a full stack app deployed to Heroku.
