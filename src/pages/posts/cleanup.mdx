## The error message:

```
Can't perform a React state update on an unmounted component.
This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your
application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions and
asynchronous tasks in a useEffect cleanup function.
```

## Why is this happening?

On useEffect I was fetching data from the back-end, and updating the state (useState & useReducer):

```
 const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
 useEffect(() => {
   async function fetchData() {
     const result =
     await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
       .then((res) => res.json())
       .then((data) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
           setUsers(data);
           dispatch({ type: 'in' });
         }, 3000);
       });
   }
   fetchData();
 }, []);

```

The problem is that the fetch request takes time (in the case above I'm forcing the error with setTimeOut), and the component has unmounted when the async request finishes.

## Reading the error message

The code (after the await) is trying to update the state even if the component no longer is on the page.

The error message itself suggests a cleanup function

# What is a Cleanup function?

If you return a function within the useEffect hook, React will run it when it is time to clean up:

```
 const [users, setUsers] = useState([]);
 useEffect(() => {
   let isCancelled = false;
   async function fetchData() {
     const result =
     await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
       .then((res) => res.json())
       .then((data) => {
         setTimeout(() => {
           if (!isCancelled) {
             setUsers(data);
             dispatch({ type: 'in' });
           }
         }, 3000);
       });
   }
   fetchData();
   return () => (isCancelled = true);
 }, []);

```

React runs the clean up when component unmounts - solving our problem.
